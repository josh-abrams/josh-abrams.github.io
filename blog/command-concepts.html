	<h4>Why should I care about version control?</h4>

	Good question! If you could just as easily update your code in OSX or Windows, you could save yourself the hassle of working in the command line and then everything would go faster and you wouldn't need to learn anything right? Well, yeah except that every time you want to save a new version of your work and keep the old one, you'd have to copy everything back into a new folder and copy everything over which takes up precious time and local hard drive space. All you really have to do to save over your ENTIRE project in git is just stage it and commit it which takes like 5 seconds. And what if you want to collaborate? It would be a huge hassle if everyone was just jumping onto one FTP site and updating one version of code. Everyone would be saving over and deleting everyone else's work and it would be a pain to track down who did what. That's why version control makes things easier for developers.

	<h4>How will git help me keep track of changes?</h4>

	Every time you make a commit in git, the whole project gets a snapshot. You can check your git log and review the messages left during each commit. You can also jump back to or reset to previous commits. You can laso pull data from the GitHub repository and compare changes in your code with recent releases.

	<h4>Why should I use GitHub to store my code?</h4>

	It's fast and convenient and allows anyone to contribute to fleshing out your ideas. It's also pretty mainstream today, so more people will get to see your code and that can help you down the line when you need to network. The social networking aspect of GitHub allows you to find other projects to work on and study other people's code for inspiration as well.
